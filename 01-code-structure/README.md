# Next.js

Next.js is a popular open-source React framework that allows developers to build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. It provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and built-in API routes for building full-stack applications.

## Features

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, offering fast page loads and better SEO.
- **File-based Routing**: Automatically maps files in the `pages` directory to routes, making routing setup simple.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Splits code automatically for each page, reducing the initial load time.
- **API Routes**: Create serverless functions within the project, enabling backend functionality directly in your app.
- **Built-in CSS & Sass Support**: Easily include global CSS or Sass files without configuration.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images for better performance.
